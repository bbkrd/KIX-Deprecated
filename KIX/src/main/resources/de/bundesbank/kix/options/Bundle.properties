KIXPanel.descriptionText.text=Determines whether the results of the first year are displayed in the results panel in case of imputation. More precisely, when a weighting series does not cover the year before the start year of the respective index series, the previous-year weights for the start year are always approximated with the weights of the start year itself (annual average in case of annual overlap and last period in case of one-period overlap) and used in all subsequent calculations. However, the user can decide whether or not the final outcome of the command is displayed for the start year.
