        <p>Version:2015-06-24</p>
        <h2>Aggregation of chain indices with plus and minus</h2>
        <p><b>Enter: [Name=]KIX,i1,w1,+/-,i2,w2,...,refyr</b></p>
        <p>Execution of the calculation loops: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Entries are read into the system and evaluated from left to right, ie starting with i1, w1.<br/>
                Each loop operation produces two interim values in the form of an aggregated index and a </li>

            <li>weight (simple +/-) which can then be used for the next addition or subtraction. </li>
            <li>As a final step the last calculated index is normalised to match with the reference year (refyr).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Note:</b>If you use different starting years for the KIX formula this may cause the entry sequence to <br/>
            influence the first year of the final result wherever more than two input indices exist.<br/>
            This effect stems from the fact that interim results contain starting years that are sequentially dependent.</p>
        <h3>Aggregating two indices (i1, w1) +/- (i2, w2)</h3>
        <p>Firstly, a check is made for the following conditions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>weight series must not begin after corresponding index series<br/>
                (However, all weight values preceding the latest index starting time are ignored during calculation.)</li>
            <li>during the first year index series must be defined from their first period onward</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a next step both index series are unchained.<br/>
            These unchained series are then aggregated, ie a weighted total or difference is calculated on a value-by-value basis<br/>
            To do this the previous year averages from the weight series are applied as weights.<br/>
            The resulting series is then chain-linked and normalised.</p>

<h2>Calculating growth contributions</h2>
<p><b>Enter: [Name=]WBG,iContr,wContr,+/-,iTotal,wTotal,#ofLags</b></p>
<p>Firstly,a check is made for the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>weight series must not start later than corresponding index series<br/>
        (However, any weight values positioned before the latest index starting point are excluded from the calculation.)</li>
    <li>for their first year index series must be defined from the first period onward</li>
    <li>the iContr series must not start later than iTotal</li>
</ul>

<p>	As a next step, iTotal is normalised to the year when it started in order to enable subsequent comparison with an auxiliary series.<br/>
    Following this we calculate both auxiliary series iRes and wRes.</p>

<ul>
    <li>iRes represents
        <ul>
            <li>for a positive entry &quot;+&quot;: the difference between two indices iTotal &quot;-&quot; iContr</li>
            <li>for a negative entry &quot;-&quot;: the sum of two indices iTotal &quot;+&quot; iContr</li>
        </ul>
        (In each case both indices are unchained then weighted using the previous year averages for wTotal and wContr<br/>
        in order to create the sum or difference. iRes is left unchained.)
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>wRes represents
        <ul>
            <li>for a positive entry &quot;+&quot;: the simple difference between two time series wTotal - wContr</li>
            <li>for a negative entry &quot;-&quot;: the simple sum of two time series wTotal + wContr</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>	As a next step, iContr is lagged with #ofLags periods.<br/>
    The lagged series is unchained using the previous year averages from the unlagged series.</p>
<p>This series is then weighted together with iRes as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>for a positive entry &quot;+&quot;: as weighted sum</li>
    <li>for a negative entry &quot;-&quot;: as weighted difference</li>
</ul>

<p>	To do this the previous year averages for wContr (unlagged!) and wRes are applied as weights.<br/>
    The resulting aggregate is then chain-linked, though in this case using the previous year averages from the unchained iTotal. <br/>
    As an interim result we get the time series iTotalLag. This series is normalised to match its starting year; it therefore can be compared with iTotal. <br/>
    Now we determine the relative differences to the #OfLags-th preceding period of iTotal for both iTotal and iTotalLag. <br/>
    The final growth contribution figure is produced by subtracting the difference for iTotalLag from the difference for iTotal.</p>

<p><b><i>Normalising a time series to match a reference year</i></b></p>
<p>	Normalising the average of the unadjusted data in the reference year to 100 yields the values<br/>
    of the aggregate in the reference year as the weighted sum of the index values of the components, whereby the share of<br/>
    the reference year volumes (valued at the average prices in the previous year) yields the weighting scheme.<br/>
    However, as the volumes used as weights are not available directly, they are calculated as the product of the nominal<br/>
    figures from the previous year and the change factor of the annual volumes.</p>
<p><u>Example</u></p>
<p>Aggregation of two calendar-adjusted time series A and B in the reference year</p>
